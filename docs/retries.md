# Optimizing Job Retries

Implementing strategic job retry mechanisms enhances the fault tolerance of your job processing system, ensuring efficiency even in the face of failures.

## Customizing Retry Delays

Adopting an exponential backoff strategy for retry delays helps balance between immediate retries and waiting too long, effectively managing both transient and persistent failures.

### Exponential Backoff Strategy

```go
import "math"

// Exponential backoff increases delay between retries, optimizing for temporary outage recovery.
func ExponentialBackoffDelay(attempts int, _ error) time.Duration {
    return time.Duration(math.Pow(float64(attempts), 2)) * time.Second
}
```

### Applying to a Job Handler

```go
handler := queue.NewHandler(
    "process_job",
    ProcessJobHandler,
    queue.WithRetryDelayFunc(ExponentialBackoffDelay), // Implement custom retry delay
)
```

This setup applies escalating delay times for retries, efficiently spacing out retry attempts.

## Distinguishing Failure Types

Identifying the nature of failures allows for more intelligent retry decisions, conserving resources and reducing unnecessary retries.

### Handling Temporary Failures

Temporary issues should trigger retries without impacting the retry count, aiding in self-recovery of transient problems.

```go
func ProcessJobHandler(ctx context.Context, job *queue.Job) error {
    if temporaryIssue() {
        return queue.ErrTransientIssue // Signals a retry without penalty
    }
    // Job processing logic
    return nil
}
```

### Addressing Permanent Failures

For errors unlikely to be resolved with retries, prevent further attempts to save resources.

```go
func ProcessJobHandler(ctx context.Context, job *queue.Job) error {
    if irreversibleError() {
        return queue.NewSkipRetryError("Unrecoverable error identified") // Cease retries
    }
    // Job processing logic
    return nil
}
```
